## MILESTONES ACHIEVED
* Flipkart Search - Product Search and its image and URL Display
* Amazon Search - Product Search and its image and URL Display
* Used Django framework For Running Web scraping Python Script At Backend.
* Added "Add To Card" Feature. 
* Used Mongodb as Database For Saving Products.
* Used Django Models For User Sign up and Authentication.

## Unique
   Initially We got stuck in product scraping at Amazon.The E-commerce websites such as Amazon and Flipkart have different structure for electronic and household products.We Corrected It using Two for Loops for covering maximum range of products.Additionally Due to High Security At Amazon Our Requests were often blocked.We fixed This Issue By Sending Requests at random time intervals.
